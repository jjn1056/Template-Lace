The following logs changes for the CPAN distribution Template::Lace

0.008   July 16 2017
        - BREAKING CHANGE: calling ->repeat on Template::Lace::DOM now requires
          that you return the new DOM object, rather than changing the existing
          one.  Sorry, just was the only way I could fix some serious repeat issues.
          Think of repeat as if its like 'map'.  Depending on how your are using
          this you might actually get away with no changes, you'll have to test.
        - POD Fixes.
        - More extensive example application in the /examples directory FWIW.

0.007   June 28 2017
        - Fixed a bug where certain input types got a value even where there
          wasn't one.
        - Some new DOM helpers and documented others that existed but where not
          in the POD yet, added some tests;

0.006   22 June 2017
        - Fixed missing test dependencies
        - New helper methods on Template::Lace::DOM for working with forms

0.005   22 May 2017
        - Fixed the AutoTemplate role

0.004   22 May 2017
        - We removed Template::Lace::ModelRole since it wasn't needed.
        - arguments on components declared in templates can now pass complex
          data (using JSON).
        - shortcut on 'class' helper to make it easier to set several classes.
        - Removed accidental warnings in code
        - added 'value' attribute helper
        - when using DOM->do you can use '.' as the CSS match specification
          to indicate 'current DOM'.

0.003   12 May 2017
        - More HTML attribute helpers
        - new Template::Lace::DOM method to run transforms under a context
        - new Template::Lace::DOM method to run a list of actions to take
          on the DOM.
        - new Renderer shortcut methods 'call' and 'call_at' to make it easier
          to call methods on the Model to tranform the current DOM

0.002   25 April 2017
        - Fixed POD errors in previous version

0.001   25 April 2017
