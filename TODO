-- Not in love with multiple inheritance design...
-- And not in love with the one class to rule them all either.
-- should components be able to get info from each other?
-- Catalyst 'subrequest' handler example
-- Need to go through this again an mark methods as 'non public'

-- What about the idea of allowing component callbacks on attributes
    and not just tags?:
    eg: <a helper-href="['user',$.c.args,{page:'1'}]">
   Would maybe use JSONY or similar to create the attributes?
