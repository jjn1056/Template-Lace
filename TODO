-- the idea of components probably needs to be
   core again.  and new attributes 'view' (view that
   created the component or undef) and 'container'
   which is the component that 'contains' a component.
   'children' should be the opposite, the components
   that a container is holding.  This should be enough
   to allow some level of 'smarts' between components.
-- Not sure if needed but explore the notion of component
   generated events that other components can subscribe
   too.
