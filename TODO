-- the idea of components probably needs to be
   core again.  and new attributes 'view' (view that
   created the component or undef) and 'container'
   which is the component that 'contains' a component.
   'children' should be the opposite, the components
   that a container is holding.  This should be enough
   to allow some level of 'smarts' between components.
-- Not sure if needed but explore the notion of component
   generated events that other components can subscribe
   too.
-- Use case, a view has a component that is passed params
   but some params are 'setup/application'.  For example
   a component injects a formhandler model, based on passed
   parameters.  Maybe what we need is a component that does 
   nothing by inject others?
